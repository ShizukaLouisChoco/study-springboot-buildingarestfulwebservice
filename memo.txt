Dependency : Spring Web

1) Create a Resource Representation Class
    service interaction :
    the service handle GET requests for /greeting
    optionally with a name parameter in the query string
    GET request should return a 200 OK response with JSON in the body that represents a greeting

    output pr√©vu :
    {
        "id": 1,
        "content": "Hello, World!"
    }

    id field is a unique identifier for the greeting
    content is the textual representation of the greeting
    To model the greeting representation, create a resource representation class with fields, constructors and accessors for the id and content data in Greeting.java

    *This application uses the Jackson JSON library to automatically marshal instances of type Greeting into JSON.Jackson is included by default by the web starter

2) Create a Resource Controller
    To build RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller
    These components are identifies by the @RestController annotation.
    The GreetingController handles GET requests for /greeting by returning a new instance of the Greeting class
